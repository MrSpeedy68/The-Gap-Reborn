The Gap Reborn
 
This game was created in 48 hours for the 2022 Global Game Jam which I hosted at the Waterford Institute of Technology for all Students.

This game was built using the Unity 3D game engine. The Gap is a lap time racing game where you have to achieve your fastest lap by hitting every checkpoint across the map. There are various maps and vehicles to try out. Try beat the fastest time. To play choose a map and then select if you wish to choose Day or Night. Then you are off to the races. If you get stuck or crash press 'R' to restart at the nearest checkpoint
